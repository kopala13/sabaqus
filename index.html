        <p><b>In the first third of the Dragon Ball manga (which served as the source material for the eponymous anime), Goku and a huge cast of friends and enemies search for the magical Dragon Balls that they could use to make a wish come true, and encounter many characters and adventures along the way. In between Dragon Ball hunts, Goku and his martial arts-inclined friends train and compete in the periodic "Tenkaichi Bud≈çkai" tournament (known as the World Martial Arts Tournament in the West).</b></p>
